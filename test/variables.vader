Before (set up auto origami):
  set foldmethod=marker
  set foldenable
  let g:auto_origami_foldcolumn = 4
  let g:auto_origami_default = 5

Given (a file with no folds):
  This is some text

Execute (AutoOrigamiFoldColumn):
  AutoOrigamiFoldColumn

Then (assert the foldcolumn is 5):
  AssertEqual 5, &foldcolumn

Given vim (a file with a fold):
  " One Fold {{{

  " End }}}

Execute (AutoOrigamiFoldColumn):
  AutoOrigamiFoldColumn

Then (assert the foldcolumn is 4):
  AssertEqual 4, &foldcolumn

Given vim (a file with nested folds):
  " Fold {{{

  " Nested Fold {{{
  " End Fold }}}

  " End Fold }}}

Execute (AutoOrigamiFoldColumn):
  AutoOrigamiFoldColumn

Then (assert the foldcolumn is 4):
  AssertEqual 4, &foldcolumn

Given vim (a file with multiple folds):
  " Fold {{{

  " Nested Fold {{{
  " End Fold }}}

  " End Fold }}}

  " Fold {{{

  " Nested Fold {{{
  " End Fold }}}

  " End Fold }}}

Execute (AutoOrigamiFoldColumn):
  AutoOrigamiFoldColumn

Then (assert the foldcolumn is 4):
  AssertEqual 4, &foldcolumn
